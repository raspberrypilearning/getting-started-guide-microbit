## Introduction

The BBC micro:bit is a pocket-sized computer that has sensors and outputs built in. You can use it to create physical computing projects that interact with the real world.

[The micro:bit Foundation](https://microbit.org/){:target="_blank"} is an educational charity that created the micro:bit and the [MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#){:target="_blank"} to get young people excited about coding.

### What you will make

You will take a tour of both the micro:bit device and MakeCode editor. You will connect your micro:bit to your computer, pair it with MakeCode, and download your program onto the physical device.

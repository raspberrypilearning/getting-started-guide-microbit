## Introduction

In this project you will connect a micro:bit to a computer and learn how to program it using the MakeCode editor.

The BBC micro:bit is a pocket sized computer that you can use to create physical computing projects that interact with the real world. There are a number of sensors and output devices built into the micro:bit that you can quickly use to create some impressive computing projects! 

[The micro:bit Foundation](https://microbit.org/){:target="_blank"} is an educational charity that uses the micro:bit to get young people excited about making computing projects that matter to them. They also develop the [MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/#){:target="_blank"} that allows you to create programs for the micro:bit, and download them onto the device.

### What you will make

You will take a tour of both the micro:bit device and MakeCode editor. You will connect your micro:bit to your computer, pair it with MakeCode and download your program onto the physical device. The rest of this project will showcase the different types of components on the micro:bit that you can use to create your programs.

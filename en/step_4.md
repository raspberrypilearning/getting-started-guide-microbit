If your micro:bit isn't showing up, try unplugging it and plugging it back in. You can also try a different USB port or USB cable if they are available.

If your micro:bit doesn't pair you can use the **Download** button to download your program as a `.HEX` file. You can then move the program onto your micro:bit using your file system.

**Windows:** Open **File Explorer** and check that you can see `MICROBIT` under `This PC` on the left hand side. If it is there, drag the downloaded `.HEX` file to it, your program will be saved to your micro:bit and you should be able to use it.

**MacOS:** Open **Finder** and check that you can see `MICROBIT` under `Locations` on the left hand side. If it is there, drag the downloaded `.HEX` file to it, your program will be saved to your micro:bit and you should be able to use it.

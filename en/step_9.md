## Powering the micro:bit

In this step, you will learn how to run your micro:bit when it is not connected to the computer. 

For this step, you will need the **battery pack** and **batteries** that came with your micro:bit.

If you didn't get any batteries or a battery pack, don't worry! You can still do all the amazing micro:bit projects that we at the Raspberry Pi Foundation and the micro:bit Foundation have created to help and inspire you. 

The connector used for the battery pack is a quite common **2 pin** connector. So if you have another battery pack that takes only two batteries, you should be able to use that.

### Connect the batteries

--- task ---

Make sure the program you want to run is on the micro:bit.

There is a line on one side of the battery pack, this will slot into the groove on the battery pack connector.

The micro:bit should power up, and run the program you downloaded onto it.

--- task ---

You can reset the micro:bit by clicking the button next to the battery pack connector on the back on the micro:bit.

### Try out your programs!

--- task ---

Make sure to disconnect the battery pack before you plug your micro:bit back in to your computer!

--- /task ---

Download a few of the programs you have made during this project onto your micro:bit.

Test them out with the battery pack; take it to show your friends or family what you have made! 

Well done, you now have loads of experience with the micro:bit!
